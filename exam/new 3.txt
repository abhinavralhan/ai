FOL ,

Last prolog programming part a)

member set : 

STRIPs : fire engine, fighter, 2 building, connect pipe and diminish the fire.

true false (is satisfiable, is valid wale questions)

UFPP interpretations

BFS, Iterative DFS  (2 goal nodes)

True false of the theory of bfs, dfs, bi directional (with respect to their time complexities) 

Search problem : Queens problem , min(h1, h2) 


900 - - - - - - - - -  902    
	every digit  +1 one time only,, to reach 902 
	
	many true false questions based on the above question. (at least 10) 
	
	
Default theory with extensions. (different question) 

Admissible , complete, stable (3 to 4 diagrams were present)  

   1- 2- 3- ....- n   connected to again 1 = write its complete set.

2 theory questions - agent based, blah blah    


A star search : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TsL96NAZCo 
Answer set programming : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDjmqycSy_o&t=394s and few of his playlists (was not in exam)
Admissible argumentation topic : watch lecture video for this topic  



ai
scoring - dfs bfs a*, strips, logics, default theory - tree, argumentation(3 graphs), Agents and multi agent systems (theory question)
not sure - prologs, search problems, in-uninformed logics
